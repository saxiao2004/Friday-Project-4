# Friday-Project-4

The goal of the project is to practice prompting generative AI systems and practice committing files in GitHub.

The following would include a read-me file for the following 3 previous projects.

# Friday Project 1 Mad Lib
1. def mad_libs():: Defines the main function for the Mad Libs program.
2.  Get words from the user: Comments indicating that the program is prompting the user for input.

6.	if __name__ == "__main__":: Ensures that the program runs when executed directly.

# Friday Project 2 PowerBall
1. import random: Imports the random module for generating random numbers.
2. def generate_powerball_numbers():: Defines the main function for the PowerBall number generator.
3. Ask the user if they want PowerBall numbers: Comments indicating that the program is prompting the user for input.
4. white_ball_1 = random.randint(1, 69): Generates a random number for the first white ball.
5. Display the generated numbers with proper spacing: Comments indicating that the program is formatting and displaying the generated numbers.
6.	print(f"Your PowerBall numbers are: {powerball_numbers}"): Prints the generated PowerBall numbers.
7.	if __name__ == "__main__":: Ensures that the program runs when executed directly.
